# Design Options

Manage visibility of mutually exclusive design options.

Useful to quickly change and compare different alternatives, such as different
furniture in interior design, room layouts in architecture, building placement
in urban design and more. Helps evaluate design options with clients and other
stakeholders by swiftly jumping back and forth.

Instead of manually searching through the Tags panel for the thing you are
already looking at in the model view and having to click twice to hide on tag
and show another, effortlessly cycle between the options.

## Set Up

Create a series of Tags prefixed by "Option", the choice, a colon and the name
of each alternative, like:

- Option Fireplace: Scandi
- Option Fireplace: Farmhouse
- Option Fireplace: Victorian

Attach these tags to the grops and components you are choosing between.

## Usage

Activated from **Extensions > Eneroth Design Options**. Hover one of these
tagged entities, hold Shift and scroll to cycle the visible option.
Alternatively use the context menu.
